# Sorry-
A Java based GUI app for the classic board game 'Sorry!'
Game currently uses pop-up menus for gameplay.
A few bugs still exist, which will be worked out in future updates.
Working on making game button-based so players can click pawns that have available moves and click to move them to a new available position. Pawns with moves will be highlighted, as will spaces they can currently move to upon clicking them.
